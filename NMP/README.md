This project is developed in Python 3.7.x

to install all the dependencies, type:
```pip install requirements.txt``` <br>
**Note: We did not develop in virtual environment so requirements.txt includes all
libraries associated with my python 3.7. Test the code in a virtual env or 
a virtual machine if you don't want all the unnecessary libraries.

To train the model: ```python _train.py``` <br>
To generate music sequence: ```python _output.py```
